This is a blog site designed with microservices architecture using `Spring Cloud Netflix` features, `Kotlin` as a main server side language and `Angular` for user interface parts. This is a very beginning development phase, so the project contains only few services for now (frontend, backend api, config server, service discovery) but will grow in future.
