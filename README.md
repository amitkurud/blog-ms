Awesome blog
=============

[![TravisCI Build](https://travis-ci.org/hiper2d/awesome-blog.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hiper2d/awesome-blog)

This is a blog site designed with microservices architecture using `Spring Cloud Netflix` features, `Kotlin` as a main server side language and `Angular` for user interface parts. This is a very beginning development phase, so the project contains only few services for now (frontend, backend-api, OAuth2 server and service discovery) but will grow in future.
